## VeriRandom

VeriRandom is a fair random-selection application for classrooms, teams, events, decision-making, and other scenarios.

## Features

### Draw workflows

- **Roll call**: Supports standard random, history-balanced, and repeat-control draws.
- **Quick draw**: Quickly draws students through a standalone floating window.
- **Lottery**: Supports prize-wheel and inventory draws, with students and prizes managed independently.
- **Rich presentation**: Provides unified settings for animation, results, speech, music, and notifications, with fallback when a notification fails.

### Fairness and list management

- Dynamically adjusts weights using history count, draw interval, group, gender, and other factors to reduce repeats and distribution imbalance.
- Uses stable internal identifiers to preserve history; student numbers, IDs, and names are display information only.
- Supports multiple student lists, prize pools, and `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` import, mapping, and preview.
- Saves history for every draw round for convenient review.

### Reviewable draw results

- Every draw automatically saves a proof record file.
- You can choose to involve the server in and witness the draw process.
- Draw results can be checked again through official channels.

### Data, privacy, and security

- Settings, lists, and history can all be imported, exported, backed up, and restored.
- Backups may include lists, history, draw proofs, images, and audio, but never passwords or other security information.
- Password, TOTP, or USB-drive protection can secure important operations, and you can choose which operations require verification.

### Verification boundaries

| Mode | What it can do | What it cannot prove |
|---|---|---|
| Offline proof | Review a completed draw process; later edits, deletions, and a wiped-and-rebuilt chain are all detectable | It cannot prove that the local program, random seed, or roster was unchanged **before** the draw, nor rule out repeated trials and selection before it |
| Online witnessing | Protect the draw flow after the server locks it | It cannot prove that the roster is authentic, complete, or unfiltered before submission |

Notes:

- Every draw saves a locally replayable proof immediately and submits that same proof for server replay signing; its digest also goes to a third-party time-stamp authority (the digest only — never the roster or the draw content)
- Local proofs form an append-only hash chain, so deleting or rewriting one leaves a gap; the service remembers the chain head it has seen for each device, so wiping local proofs and rebuilding the chain is reported as a backwards chain position
- A proof commits a digest of the "record id to name/number/group" mapping of the roster it used, so editing the list **after** the draw to point a winning record at someone else is detectable
- Filtering the roster **before** the draw (deleting or disabling a student first) cannot be proven: the digest only covers the roster as it stood at draw time. Covering that would need a "confirm the roster with a third party before drawing" flow, which is not implemented

## Technical evolution

| Version | Stack | Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | Python + PyQt5 + qfluentwidgets | First desktop implementation |
| v2 | Python + PySide6 + qfluentwidgets | Qt stack evolution |
| **v3** | **C# + Avalonia + FluentAvalonia** | .NET desktop rewrite for continued draw, verification, and desktop-integration development |

- VeriRandom is released under [GNU GPLv3](../LICENSE).
- See [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) for third-party components, copyright information, and distribution-review notes.
- History-balanced weights and candidate filters help reduce repeat selections and improve long-term distribution. They do not replace management of real-world rosters, rules, or processes, and VeriRandom does not claim to verify those conditions.
