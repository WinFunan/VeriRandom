# SecRandom.Core/ AGENTS.md

<!--
Core supplement to ../AGENTS.md. Update this file when
draw/config/logging services, shared controls/styles, or registry helpers move.
AI agents touching those areas must update this file in the same task.

This is the VeriRandom fork. Any Core divergence from upstream SecRandom (behavior, defaults,
services, resources) must also be logged in ../DownStream_Change.md in the same change.
An unlogged fork change is an incomplete change.

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task                       | Location                                                                         | Notes                                                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service access             | `Abstraction/IAppHost.cs`                                                        | Static Host holder and service helpers.                                 |
| Profile contract           | `Abstraction/Services/IProfileService.cs`                                        | Current profile/list/history boundary, including active student-profile switching. |
| Plugin view contracts      | `Abstraction/Services/Views/`                                                    | `IDrawerView`/`IMainView`/`ISettingsView` plugin-facing drawer/navigation contracts; app shells provide adapters. |
| Page metadata              | `Attributes/PageInfoAttribute.cs`, `Models/PageInfo.cs`                          | Used by registration extensions.                                        |
| Page registration          | `Extensions/Registry/`                                                           | `AddMainPage`, `AddSettingsPage`, group/separator helpers.              |
| Navigation registry        | `Services/PagesRegistryService.cs`                                               | Static main/settings/group collections.                                 |
| Attached-settings registry | `Services/AttachedSettingsRegistryService.cs`                                    | Static attached-settings control collections.                           |
| Draw algorithm             | `Services/Draw/DrawEngine*.cs`, `WeightedDrawEngine.cs`, `CryptoRandomSource.cs` | Fairness, mandatory average-gap candidate gate, share-debt weighted sampling (dimension horizon scales with batch size), filters; history lookup uses `RecordId`. Repeat thresholds and candidate filtering live in the shared `DrawRepeatPolicy`/`DrawCandidateFilter`. |
| Verification seeds         | `Services/Verification/` | `VerificationSeedDerivation` (local CSPRNG / server-derived seeds), `BeaconSeedDerivation` (pure beacon→seed KDF), `BeaconSequencePolicy` (per-pulse sequence forced to start at 0 and +1 per draw), `BeaconEndpointPolicy` (official NIST v2 default, remote HTTPS only), `BeaconPulsePeriodPolicy` (the time-stamp period preset: accepts that period's pulse or the previous one inside tolerance). Core stays UI/HTTP/file free: fetching, sequence persistence, and proof wiring live in the app layer. |
| Draw commit boundary       | `Services/Draw/DrawCommitCoordinator.cs`, `Abstraction/Services/IDrawCommitService.cs` | Single-`DrawRoundId` transactional commit: temporary records before history, failure snapshot compensation, serialized commit gate. |
| Config handlers            | `Services/Config/`                                                               | `FileConfigService`, `MainConfigHandler`, and `ProfileConfigs` implement host-internal JSON persistence. `ConfigHandlerBase.Saved` fires after a successful write so the app layer can refresh the settings-file integrity fingerprint. |
| Profile runtime            | `Services/Profiles/ProfileService.cs`                                            | Injected current-list/history runtime shared by desktop and mobile hosts. |
| Profile catalog            | `Services/Profiles/ProfileCatalogManager.cs`                                     | List/profile CRUD, rename/file migration, and student/prize history clearing behind `IProfileCatalogManager`. |
| Roster import              | `Services/Profiles/RosterImportParser.cs`                                        | Shared roster spreadsheet parsing/column mapping used by desktop and mobile import flows. |
| Temporary draw records     | `Services/Draw/DrawTemporaryRecordService.cs`                                   | Host-internal student/prize temporary records shared by desktop and mobile hosts; automatic exhausted-round resets use `ResetStudentList`/`ResetPrizeList` to atomically overwrite an empty file, while manual `Clear*` operations keep their destructive semantics. |
| Feature availability       | `Services/FeatureAvailabilityService.cs`                                        | `MoreSettings.LotteryEnabled` runtime gate behind `IFeatureAvailabilityService`. |
| Usage statistics counters  | `Services/Stats/UsageMetricCounter.cs`                                           | Platform-neutral per-day/ISO-week/month/total event counters plus the pinned SECTL increment payload shape (`platform_id`/`field_key`/`delta`/`period`, field keys identical to the v2 client). Pure state: the app-layer `PlatformUsageReportService` owns persistence, debounce, and HTTP, so the counting rules stay testable. |
| Data archive runtime       | `Services/Archive/`                                                              | `DataArchiveService` (v3 settings/data transfer, manifest/SHA-256, staging commit/rollback, snapshots) with `IArchivePostImportHooks` seam for platform follow-up; registered by `AddCoreRuntimeServices`. `ArchiveKind.CloudBackup` plus the `CloudBackupRoots` ceiling and `ResolveCloudBackupRoots(BackupConfig)` define the account cloud-sync archive, and `CloudBackupPackage` owns its part/manifest format. |
| Roll-call algorithms       | `Abstraction/Services/IRollCallAlgorithm.cs`, `Services/Draw/RollCallAlgorithms.cs` | Host-registered fair/random weighting strategies with stable Id/Name; winner selection and verification remain in the existing DrawEngine/verification pipeline. |
| Lottery algorithms         | `Abstraction/Services/ILotteryAlgorithm.cs`, `Services/Draw/RollCallAlgorithms.cs` | Host-registered inventory/weighted prize candidate strategies with stable Id/Name; assignment and transactional commit remain in the app draw service. |
| Protocol parsing           | `Services/Ipc/ProtocolRequestParser.cs`                                          | Bounded route/query parser shared by URL and IPC routing. |
| Logging providers          | `Services/Logging/`                                                              | Console/file logging; file logs live under `data/logs`, current log path is exposed by `FileLoggerProvider` for viewer/diagnostics. |
| Config schema              | `Enums/Configs/`, `Models/SubConfigs/`                                           | Many settings model types live here, including v2-parity models for floating window, notification, security, linkage, voice, history, update, and more settings. |
| Shared controls            | `Controls/*.axaml(.cs)`                                                          | Reusable app controls; keep templates and code-behind paired.           |
| Cross-platform view engine | `Views/`                                                                         | Logical view lifecycle, presentation intent, DI factory/service, and host contracts. |
| Shared styles              | `StylesBase.axaml`, `Styles/*.axaml`                                             | Imported by `SecRandom/Styles.axaml`.                                   |
| Constants/helpers          | `GlobalConstants.cs`, `Helpers/`                                                 | Keep cross-cutting values here only when Core consumers need them.      |

## CONVENTIONS

- `Views/` is the public logical view-engine boundary. It may use Avalonia `Control` but must not expose `Window`, application lifetimes, native platform APIs, or raw `IServiceProvider`. Physical desktop/mobile hosts are registered by their application shells through DI.
- `ViewPresentation.Modal` renders without an automatic navigation bar. Modal callers own close/back behavior and must explicitly handle a close result when their flow depends on one.
- Existing Core services may use `IAppHost.GetService<T>()` during the transition, but `DrawEngine` and new reusable runtime services use constructor injection. Construct `DrawEngine` with `MainConfigHandler`, `IProfileService`, and `ILogger<DrawEngine>`; do not add a new static-Host dependency.
- `IProfileService.LoadStudentProfile(name)` switches the app-layer active point-call student list and matching history; callers should use it instead of constructing profile configs directly when changing the active roll-call list.
- Profile startup/switching validates nonempty names with `ProfileConfigBase` before path access or saving the active profile. Archive settings validation checks roll-call/quick-draw `DefaultClass` and lottery `DefaultPool` before snapshots or commit; the exact empty string means no selection, not a file name.
- Registration helpers are responsible for both keyed DI and `PagesRegistryService` metadata.
- `DrawEngine` is partial: keep filtering in `DrawEngine.Filter.cs`, weight math in `DrawEngine.WeightCalculator.cs`,
  orchestration in `DrawEngine.cs`.
- Weighted drawing validates count, candidates, and weights before sampling; preserve explicit `DrawStatus` returns over
  exceptions at public boundary.
- Draw fairness/repeat history for students and prizes must use `ProfileRecordIdentity`/`RecordId` first. Legacy `Id`/`Name` history fallback is only for backward compatibility and must stay ambiguity-safe.
- Draw commits are coordinator-only: app sessions and page ViewModels must call `IDrawCommitService` (`DrawCommitCoordinator`) instead of pairing temporary-record writes with `IProfileService.Record*History`. The optional `drawRoundId` (and `drawMethod` on `RecordPrizeHistory`) parameters exist for coordinator use; a mid-commit failure rolls back through snapshot compensation, and commits serialize behind the coordinator gate.
- Student fair-draw execution must support explicit internal policy snapshots. Desktop public `DrawEngine` methods stay byte-compatible by deriving a `DesktopConfigured` snapshot from live `MainConfigModel.FairDrawSettings`; mobile fair draws use the fixed `MobileDesktopDefaultsV1` snapshot and must not read persisted fair-setting values.
- Verification proof inputs commit a `VerificationSamplingMode` and `VerificationAlgorithmProfile`. The profile must match the draw kind and sampler: fair/random students use history-balanced or unit-weight sampling when no behind-scene rule is active, student behind-scene weighting uses a dedicated profile, Count lottery uses equal-probability partial inventory permutation without behind-scene rules, and Pan or an internal-rule fallback uses weighted-without-replacement. Any internal rule, including zero-probability exclusions, must stay visible in the ordinary verification draw's anonymous audit payload. Formal notarization is the explicit exception: it must ignore internal rules completely and omit them from its locked input and audit payload.
- Config handlers derive from `ConfigHandlerBase<TModel>`; config model defaults should be safe without existing data
  files.
- `FileConfigService`, `ProfileService`, `DrawTemporaryRecordService`, and the concrete feature-availability service are private implementation details behind `AddCoreRuntimeServices()`. Desktop and mobile call that registration extension from their composition roots while exposing only the established narrow contracts to consumers.
- `Services/Archive/` owns all v3 settings/data ZIP and settings-JSON transfer: `DataArchiveService` performs producer-version/manifest/SHA-256 validation, staging commit/rollback, and mandatory pre-import snapshots. The producer-version gate compares only the numeric core's major after stripping the optional `v` prefix and any SemVer pre-release/build suffix, because `producer_version` is the raw `GlobalConstants.Version` and a pre-release build (`v3.0.0-alpha.2`) must accept its own exports. Platform-specific follow-up stays behind `IArchivePostImportHooks`; `AddCoreRuntimeServices()` registers the Null hooks and shells override them (desktop: `DesktopArchivePostImportHooks`).
- Account cloud sync reuses that engine: `ExportCloudBackupAsync` writes an `ArchiveKind.CloudBackup` archive whose root set is resolved by `ResolveCloudBackupRoots(BackupConfig)` from the dedicated `CloudInclude*` selection and capped by `CloudBackupRoots` (no device identity, voice cache, draw proofs, theme resources, or logs — the cloud content list has no row for any of them), `InspectCloudBackupAsync`/`ImportCloudBackupAsync` accept only that kind, and the import filters `config/device-uuid.json` out of its commit roots so a crafted cloud archive can never re-identify the device. `CloudBackupPackage` is UI-free and transport-free: it owns part naming, backup-id generation and safety, the optional device alias a backup id carries (`BuildDeviceTag`/`CreateBackupId`/`TryGetDeviceTag`), splitting, manifest validation, and whole-archive verification, while upload/download/HTTP and the alias choice (`BackupConfig.CloudDeviceAlias`) stay in the app layer.
- IPC parser code is UI-free and must reject ambiguous routes, malformed percent escapes, control characters, oversized frames, and unsupported schemes. Keep route execution in the app layer.
- File logging should keep user-facing log messages in Chinese for app events. Avoid logging student/prize names or full config payloads; prefer counts, status, file names, and operation names.
- V2-parity settings models that are shared by app settings pages but not yet backed by services live directly under `Models/SubConfigs/` and hang off `MainConfigModel` until their runtime service boundaries settle. `MoreSettingsConfig` also owns built-in draw page chrome toggles such as roll-call/lottery control panel placement and visibility.
- Linkage enums and course snapshot DTOs are UI-free Core contracts. The app owns CSES files, ClassIsland IPC, timers, and window behavior. Student draw APIs may accept an optional course name to project `HistoryItem.CourseName`; empty course input must retain global-history behavior.
- Attached settings models under `Models/AttachedSettings/` may target students and prizes. `SpecificAnnouncementAttachedSettings` stores per-record TTS alias, prefix, and suffix; `DrawMusicAttachedSettings` stores per-record animation/result track IDs. App-layer controls/services render and consume both. `DrawSettingsConfigBase.VoiceAnnouncementEnabled` uses the existing default-and-per-draw override pattern; `VoiceSettings.VoiceEnable` remains the runtime total switch. The app-facing `ISpeechProvider` and `ISpeechAudioPlayer` contracts live under `Abstraction/Services` so voice acquisition remains separate from playback; synthesis stays at normal speed, while the single SoundFlow player applies the configured speed through pitch-preserving WSOLA time stretching. `VoiceSettingsConfig` also carries the OmniTTS engine-2 fields (`OmniTtsProvider`, `OmniTtsApiBaseUrl`, `OmniTtsModel`, `OmniTtsVoiceId`, `OmniTtsInstructions`); the engine int and per-provider default helpers live in the app-layer `OmniTtsSpeechProvider`, where Gemini native TTS wraps its 24 kHz PCM response as WAV before playback. API keys never enter this model (see `OmniTtsCredentialStore`).
- Attached-settings presenter behavior separates editing from activation: the expander content should remain openable/editable even when `IsAttachSettingsEnabled` is false, while the switch only controls whether the saved settings take effect.
- `MainConfigModel.General` is the canonical general-settings subtree. Legacy root `Basic` / `Backup` bridges may remain temporarily for backward-compatible callers and JSON migration, but new general config splits should be nested under `Models/SubConfigs/General/`. Privacy settings belong under `General.PrivacySettings`; keep Sentry upload (`SentryTelemetryEnabled`) separate from online status reporting (`OnlineStatusMode`).
- Controls should keep `.axaml` and `.axaml.cs` side by side and expose reusable Avalonia properties/templates.
- `TouchInputModeAssist` tracks the latest top-level pointer mode, and `TouchTextCommandBarFlyout` provides the touch-only horizontal cut/copy/paste editor toolbar with overflow undo/redo/select-all. `Styles/TouchTextCommandBarFlyout.axaml` applies it to `TextBox` only while touch mode is active; do not replace mouse/keyboard text context menus.
- Shared styles are modular; add new broad styles under `Styles/` and include from `StylesBase.axaml`.
- `MultiComboBox` (`SecRandom.Core/Controls/MultiComboBox.cs`, `MultiComboBoxItem.cs`) is the in-house multi-select control; its theme lives in `Styles/MultiComboBox.axaml` and uses a shared maximum width cap so selected tags do not stretch the control indefinitely; override locally only when a page really needs a wider selection box.
- `MultiComboBox` settings should use `ItemsSource`/`SelectedItems` with plain data objects for selectable options; do not put visual controls like `TextBlock` or shapes into selectable item content, because the control stores item `DataContext` in `SelectedItems` and visual content can surface as type names in selected tags.
- Fluent icon names come from `Assets/FluentSystemIcons-Resizable.json` and are exposed through generated `sr:Fi` enum values plus `FluentIcons.*` string constants; application-owned Core controls and styles should use `Filled` variants through `{sr:FluentIconSource {sr:Fi NameFilled}}`, `FluentIcon`, or `FluentIcons.NameFilled` instead of raw glyphs.
- Raw Fluent glyph migrations must reverse-map the code point through `Assets/FluentSystemIcons-Resizable.json` before selecting a Filled replacement. Do not modify the font, mapping JSON, or source generator for ordinary style migration; framework-owned template glyphs may remain when they use a different framework font.
- Comments should explain public-contract constraints, draw fairness reasoning, or platform quirks; avoid restating
  obvious property wiring.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not put app-window or desktop-launcher behavior in Core.
- Do not bypass draw status handling with uncaught exceptions for normal no-candidate/repeat-limit outcomes.
- Do not add page registration logic outside `Extensions/Registry/` unless changing the navigation architecture.
- Do not break `SecRandom.Shared` contract assumptions from Core models/services.
- Do not duplicate app-only localization; Core has only common/shared resources.
